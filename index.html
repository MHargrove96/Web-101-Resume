<h2 class="mcwhorters">McWhorter's Tire</h2> 
<h4 class="time">June 2018 - Present</h4> 
<p class="job">I have been in multiple positions at McWhorterâ€™s for a little over three years. Climbing the ladder has been able to give me exposure to multiple areas of a business. The jobs between my starting position and my current position have shown the gradual change of job requirements. As a tire technician, the job required much knowledge of countless safety protocols and of different tools and equipment. When I was given the roles of assistant manager, my communication skills were utilized and improved. As a sales representative, customer service skills and adaptability were expected and honed. Now, managing my own work as the National Accounts Manager and the store and employees, I have been both individually motivated and team oriented. As a manager, I have gained the insight of the necessities of balance between business and the necessities of the employees. Balancing the needs and wants of everyone is tricky, but with time and effort, it can be improved.  </p>
